# RateMySierra
##About
RateMySierra helps students choose their teachers by linking Rate My Professor to the Sierra College mySierra website.
We are a team of student developers looking to expand our skillset and networking.
This extension is in its early stages and will have many more features to come.
If you would like to contribute feel free to contact us.

##Instructions to use:
1. Log into mySierra and Click either "Class Schedule" or "Add, Drop or Withdraw from Classes > Select Term > Class Search"
2. Specify your search terms
3. Done


##How it works:
When you mouse over a teachers name, the link reloads with the direct teacher URL. It was done this way in order to decrease page load times. The process can take a second, depending on your internet speed. 
If no teachers are found for Sierra College the link will update to search for all schools.
