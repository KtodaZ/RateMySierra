# RateMySierra
##About
RateMySierra helps students choose their teachers by linking Rate My Professor to the Sierra College mySierra website. We all know that choosing classes can be a stressful and time consuming process and choosing a good teacher is critical. RateMySierra helps remedy this by turning all teacher names on the mySierra search page into hyperlinks to RateMyProfessor so that you can easily go to a teachers page. Additionally, we display professor ratings from RateMyProfessor on mouse over.
We are a team of student developers looking to expand our skillset and networking.
This extension is in its early stages and will have many more features to come.
If you would like to contribute feel free to contact us.


###Instructions to use
1. Log into mySierra and Click either "Class Schedule" or "Add, Drop or Withdraw from Classes > Select Term > Class Search"
2. Specify your search terms
3. Done


###How it works
When you mouse over a teachers name, the link reloads with the direct teacher URL. It was done this way in order to decrease page load times. The process can take a second, depending on your internet speed. 
If no teachers are found for Sierra College the link will update to search for all schools.

- v1.0.2: bugfixes, added icon at top of page when script is loaded
